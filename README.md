This is the repository for the HTTP workshop, originally create for DevOpsDays TLV 2019. The accompanying slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XkskAy-Z7n8DilrrBys8ZzmgmHq5RGzglbnafUpFyss/edit?usp=sharing).

The `levels` directory contains a series of exercises. Each subdirectory contains a python file `server.py` which should be modified where `TODO:` comments are to complete the excercises, there is also a `README.md` with relevant documentation and things to try.
